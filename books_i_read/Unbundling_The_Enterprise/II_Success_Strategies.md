### PART II SUCCESS STRATEGIES

#### Chapter 6 Strategies of Success #1: Exchange Optimization

- **Core Strategy:** Use OOOps to move from linear, siloed models toward interconnected ecosystems where value exchanges are optimized. **[BOOK]**
- **APIs as Enablers:** APIs act as the mechanism that makes value exchange between teams/partners cheaper and faster. **[BOOK]**
- **Problem: Cost/Revenue Center Silos:**
  - “Cost center vs revenue center” thinking creates misaligned incentives and friction. **[BOOK]**
  - Risk often gets pushed downstream to teams without authority to manage it. **[BOOK]**
- **Solution: Federated Operations Model:**
  - Embed operational capabilities into product/delivery teams (DevOps, FinOps, RevOps, etc.). **[BOOK]**
  - **“You build it, you run it” (Amazon):** Ownership increases quality and aligns teams with outcomes. **[BOOK EXAMPLE]**
- **Design with Disruption in Mind:**
  - There’s a tradeoff between moving fast now and building modular capabilities that preserve future options. **[BOOK]**
  - The goal is not “max modularity,” but “enough modularity to keep options open.” **[BOOK]**
- **Business–IT Collaboration Evolution:**
  - Move from “business defines what / IT builds how” toward shared ownership where teams can see the value they produce. **[BOOK]**
  - APIs treated as products support this shift (clear consumers, outcomes, and iteration). **[BOOK]**
- **Case Studies (kept high-level to avoid false precision):**
  - **Cox Automotive:** Used digital platforms/APIs to connect experiences and capabilities across a complex business ecosystem. **[BOOK CASE STUDY]**
  - **Lowe’s:** Used API-enabled digital experiences and experimentation/feedback to improve customer journeys across channels. **[BOOK CASE STUDY]**
- **Closing the Chasm:**
  - Exchange optimization is organizational, not just technical: it requires business + tech collaboration grounded in measurable outcomes. **[BOOK]**
