### PART II SUCCESS STRATEGIES

#### Chapter 6 Strategies of Success #1: Exchange Optimization

- **Core Strategy:** Use OOOps to move from linear, siloed models toward interconnected ecosystems where value exchanges are optimized. **[BOOK]**
- **APIs as Enablers:** APIs act as the mechanism that makes value exchange between teams/partners cheaper and faster. **[BOOK]**
- **Problem: Cost/Revenue Center Silos:**
  - “Cost center vs revenue center” thinking creates misaligned incentives and friction. **[BOOK]**
  - Risk often gets pushed downstream to teams without authority to manage it. **[BOOK]**
- **Solution: Federated Operations Model:**
  - Embed operational capabilities into product/delivery teams (DevOps, FinOps, RevOps, etc.). **[BOOK]**
  - **“You build it, you run it” (Amazon):** Ownership increases quality and aligns teams with outcomes. **[BOOK EXAMPLE]**
- **Design with Disruption in Mind:**
  - There’s a tradeoff between moving fast now and building modular capabilities that preserve future options. **[BOOK]**
  - The goal is not “max modularity,” but “enough modularity to keep options open.” **[BOOK]**
- **Business–IT Collaboration Evolution:**
  - Move from “business defines what / IT builds how” toward shared ownership where teams can see the value they produce. **[BOOK]**
  - APIs treated as products support this shift (clear consumers, outcomes, and iteration). **[BOOK]**
- **Case Studies (kept high-level to avoid false precision):**
  - **Cox Automotive:** Used digital platforms/APIs to connect experiences and capabilities across a complex business ecosystem. **[BOOK CASE STUDY]**
  - **Lowe’s:** Used API-enabled digital experiences and experimentation/feedback to improve customer journeys across channels. **[BOOK CASE STUDY]**
- **Closing the Chasm:**
  - Exchange optimization is organizational, not just technical: it requires business + tech collaboration grounded in measurable outcomes. **[BOOK]**

#### Chapter 7 Strategies of Success #2: Distributed Innovation

- **Core Strategy:** Scale innovation by expanding *who can build* (internal knowledge workers + external developers/customers), not just by optimizing professional dev workflows. **[BOOK]**
- **Digital demand exceeds builder supply:** Demand for digital change outpaces the number of professional builders, pushing orgs to unlock additional “builders” across the ecosystem. **[BOOK]**
- **Two levers for cheap experimentation:**
  - **Internal builders:** enable non-IT employees with safer, reusable building blocks and clearer contribution paths. **[BOOK]**
  - **External builders:** enable partners/customers/dev community to build on your capabilities (often via APIs), producing unexpected use cases and learning. **[BOOK]**
- **Customers as a source of innovation:** Stakeholders pursuing their own goals can generate business innovation—*if* tools and incentives are designed as win-win. **[BOOK]**
- **OOOps connection (short):**
  - **Optionality:** APIs/unbundled capabilities make experimentation cheaper. **[BOOK]**
  - **Opportunity:** value dynamics helps balance incentives across participants. **[BOOK]**
  - **Optimization:** feedback loops collect signals from what people actually build/use. **[BOOK]**
- **API economy context:** The rise of “API companies” shows how external developers accelerate adoption and provide continuous feedback about what works and what doesn’t. **[BOOK]**
- **Coca-Cola setup (leading into the next section):**
  - **Modernization theme:** shifting from opaque point-to-point integrations toward more modular interfaces helps decouple front-end experiences from back-end systems, lowering change risk and enabling more experiments (incl. easier migration of components over time). **[BOOK]**
  - **OOOps at Coca-Cola (high-level):**
    - **Optionality:** unbundle core capabilities into reusable digital services. **[BOOK]**
    - **Opportunity:** align business + IT on where to experiment based on needs/signals. **[BOOK]**
    - **Optimization:** build “sense and respond” loops across the ecosystem. **[BOOK]**
  - **Unexpected tech adoption:** more unbundling + feedback can lead to adopting technologies the org didn’t predict. **[BOOK] [VERIFY]**
