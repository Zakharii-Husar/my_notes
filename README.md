# My CS Learning Notes

This repository is dedicated to learning and documenting key concepts in computer science.

## Structure

Notes are organized by topic/domain:

- **`front_end/`** - Frontend development topics (JavaScript, React, etc.)

Each directory contains markdown files with detailed notes on specific topics within that domain.
